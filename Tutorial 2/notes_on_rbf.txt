3.1
  - it seems that 63 nodes (same number as samples) gives the best results. but not 100% sure

  - in order to get 0% error for the square problem we just need to pass the network output
  through the same filter as the training data.
  We still need at least N = n nodes tho (we cannot solve N > n systems with least squares)

  - "What type of applications could this be useful?"
